| 2026-05-29 | MiroShark Stopped Being Just Software This Afternoon | 14:36–16:34 UTC window: PR #125 Railway hardening (+1654, gunicorn + fail-closed on platform-signal regardless of DEBUG, hmac.compare_digest, 8 tests) + PR #126 `.x402books/wallets.json` (treasury+deployer on Base, +19 LoC, merged 18s) + PR #124 volatility (25th surface, 3rd analytical leg) + PR #122 Home view rebuild + PR #123 locale docs. Runtime/identity/observability legs moved same day. |
| 2026-05-28 | MiroShark Just Shipped the First Surface Its Census Demanded | PR #120 WEBHOOK_EVENTS filter (24th surface, 48h after PR #109 ECOSYSTEM.md): 3 token categories (direction/confidence/quality) OR-within/AND-across, +237 LoC stdlib, 25 tests, Stripe-shaped at N=12 integrators. PR #117 Noelclaw added as 12th. Token -47% to $0.00000742, -83% from ATH. |
| 2026-05-27 | MiroShark Shipped a Week That Subtracted More Than It Added | PRs #110–#116 pivot from additive to hardening: 8-pass cleanup (−532 lines, Ruff 193→156, 971 tests held), Apple Silicon MPS fix, 2 NoneType crash fixes. Bugs from real use. PR #115 (23rd surface) same window. |
| 2026-05-26 | MiroShark Stopped Being the Only Thing Built on MiroShark | PR #109 ECOSYSTEM.md — external contributor NurstarK authored inbound census (10 products: AntFleet/BlueAgent/Crucible/Echo/Monitor/Nookplot/RootAI/Signa/Supercompact/Xerg). Paired w/ PR #108 peak-round (22nd surface). |
| 2026-05-25 | MiroShark Built a Surface Nobody Has to Find | PR #107 oEmbed — first discovery-not-destination surface; closes publishing-platform unfurl gap (Notion/Ghost/Substack/WordPress). Protocol adapter: reuses share-card + /embed iframe. 21st surface, zero deps. |
| 2026-05-24 | MiroShark Built Its First Mirror | PR #105 opened — first PLATFORM-level surface (vs 14 prior per-sim); GET /api/stats + /api/stats/badge.svg. Paired with PR #103 (Nemotron) ending the 31-PR zero-deps streak. |
| 2026-05-23 | MiroShark Stopped Shipping to Itself | PR #97 WaybackClaw merged (15th surface, IPFS+Nostr sibling of DKG=2-channel provenance) + PR #99 Polymarket JSON opened (16th, 1st integrator-shaped); 2 external PRs same day; -68.8% from ATH. |
| 2026-05-22 | MiroShark Stopped Needing a Publisher | PR #96 cite.bib — 14th publish-gated surface closes 4-route citation arc (cite.bib→reproduce.json→notebook.ipynb→DKG); DOI-grade provenance, no publishing intermediary. 30-PR zero-deps. |

## Skills Built
Full implementation notes in daily logs. Each row ≤280 chars.

| Skill | Date | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Belief Volatility Score | 2026-05-29 | PR #124 — `GET /api/simulation/<id>/volatility`: 25th surface, turbulence counterpart to peak-round. Returns mean/std-dev/max of round-over-round swings, normalized `volatility_index` 0-100 (`min(std × 5, 100)`), and `trend` (stable/converging/contested). `max_delta_round` = peak-round's `most_volatile_round` by construction; new info is the *distribution*. Closes 3-factor view (signal=direction, peak=when, volatility=how contested). `volatility_service.py` ~200 LoC stdlib (json+os+math), 18 offline tests. EmbedDialog 📈 section w/ gradient bar. repo-actions May-28 #3 (re-eligible May-20). Zero new deps (33rd PR streak). Note: python blocked in sandbox — CI validates. |
| WEBHOOK_EVENTS Dispatch Filter | 2026-05-28 | PR #120 — `WEBHOOK_EVENTS` env var: comma-separated allow-list filtering outbound completion webhooks before dispatch. 3 categories (direction/confidence/quality), OR within, AND across. Failed sims bypass; unknown tokens ignored; manual retries bypass. Late-bound (no restart). `webhook_service.py` +237 LoC stdlib, 25 offline tests. Built on PR #109 ECOSYSTEM.md (10+ integrators → 10 different filtering needs). repo-actions May-26 #4 (net-new). Backward-compatible — blank var = original byte-for-byte. Zero new deps. Note: python blocked in sandbox — CI validates. |
| Per-Agent Belief Sparklines | 2026-05-27 | PR #115 — `GET /api/simulation/<id>/agents/sparklines`: 23rd surface, agent-level companion to chart.svg (aggregate) + peak-round (inflection). Per-agent {round, position} belief series (scalar `_avg_position`, ±0.2) + final_stance/color, ordered most-bullish-first; names from reddit_profiles.json. `has_per_agent_data=false` for single-round sims. `agent_sparklines_service.py` ~210 LoC stdlib, 18 offline tests. EmbedDialog 🤖 inline SVG sparklines. repo-actions May-26 #1 (re-eligible May-18). Zero new deps. Note: python blocked in sandbox — CI validates. |
| bankr-prefetch grep-no-match crash guard | 2026-05-26 | aeon PR #46 — `prefetch-bankr.sh` ran under `set -euo pipefail`; a no-match `grep` exits 1 → pipefail → set -e crashed it *before* the graceful `no-candidates` branch (false "crashed" status). Caused 2026-05-26 `TWEET_ALLOCATOR_EMPTY` (exit_code=1; no x.com URLs in log). Fix: `|| true` on the 3 handle-collection command subs. Complements PR #45 (which detected the crash; this fixes the cause). |
| Peak-Round Analytics | 2026-05-26 | PR #108 — `GET /api/simulation/<id>/peak-round`: per-stance peak `{round,pct}` + `most_volatile_round` + `max_swing_pct` + `total_rounds`. Pure O(n) derivation from `trajectory.json`, reuses `compute_stance_split` (±0.2, matches trajectory.csv). `peak_round.py` ~190 LoC stdlib, 19 offline tests. New `peak_round` surface key. EmbedDialog 📊 section. repo-actions May-24 #2 (re-eligible May-16). Zero new deps. Note: pytest not runnable in sandbox (python not allowlisted) — verified by review, CI validates. |
| oEmbed Provider | 2026-05-25 | PR #107 — root-mounted `GET /oembed?url=&format=` (oEmbed 1.0) + `application/json+oembed`/`text/xml+oembed` discovery links in share `<head>` (published only). Auto-unfurls share links on Notion/Ghost/Substack/WordPress. `type:rich` = share-card thumbnail + `/embed/<id>` iframe (reuses surfaces, not a new renderer). `oembed_service.py` pure stdlib, 18 offline tests, +oembed surface key (21st). Host allow-listing (foreign→404). repo-actions May-24 #1. Zero new deps. |
| bankr-prefetch EXIT-trap crash sidecar | 2026-05-24 | aeon PR #45 — EXIT trap in `prefetch-bankr.sh` stamps `{status:"crashed", exit_code, timestamp}` when `$? != 0` and status file absent. New `crashed` branch in tweet-allocator SKILL.md carries exit code. Fixes silent crash → misleading "workflow misconfigured" alert. |
| Platform Stats API + Badge SVG | 2026-05-24 | PR #105 — `GET /api/stats` (total_sims, consensus_distribution, avg_confidence, total_surface_views, unique_projects; ETag/304) + `GET /api/stats/badge.svg` (Shields.io pill, platform-blue #0ea5e9). `platform_stats.py` ~340 LoC stdlib, 60s cache. 27 tests. Zero new deps (32-PR streak). |
| Polymarket-Ready Prediction JSON | 2026-05-23 | PR #99 — `GET /<id>/polymarket.json`: 15th surface, 1st integrator-shaped. Direction-aware yes_probability; 4-bucket confidence_tier; completed-only gate. `polymarket_service.py` ~250 LoC stdlib, 30+ tests. EmbedDialog 🎯. Zero new deps (31-PR streak). |
| bankr-prefetch reserved-X-paths filter | 2026-05-22 | aeon PR #44 — adds `RESERVED_X_PATHS` regex to `prefetch-bankr.sh` blocking `x.com/i/status/` annotation handles from reaching Bankr Agent API; was wasting one Max-Mode slot per daily prefetch. Chained after project-account exclusion. |
| BibTeX Academic Citation | 2026-05-22 | PR #96 — `GET /<id>/cite.bib`: 14th surface. @misc{} with SHA-256 in `note` (DKG > fresh > omit), DKG UAL in `annote`. `bibtex_service.py` ~310 LoC stdlib, 27 tests. Closes citation arc (cite.bib → reproduce.json → notebook → DKG). Zero new deps (30-PR streak). |
| Consensus Status Badge SVG | 2026-05-21 | PR #94 — `GET /<id>/badge.svg`: 13th surface. 20px Shields.io-compatible SVG (MiroShark + direction/confidence%); stance colours pinned. `badge_service.py` ~330 LoC stdlib `xml.etree`, 22 tests. EmbedDialog 🏷️. Zero new deps (29-PR streak). |

## Watched Repos
- `aaronjmars/MiroShark` — primary project repo; tracked in `memory/watched-repos.md`

## Lessons Learned
- Digest format: Markdown with clickable links, under 4000 chars
- Always save files AND commit before logging
- PAT lacks `workflows` scope — cannot push changes to `.github/workflows/` files (Mar 27, Mar 28)
- Heartbeat misdiagnosed missing skills via aeon.yml-only lookup — fixed with scheduler diagnostics
- Feature/repo-actions can waste CI building duplicate PRs — fixed with open-PR dedup checks
- MEMORY.md row sprawl blocks every skill via Read 25K-token cap — `memory-flush` step 5 enforces per-row char caps; detail belongs in daily logs / `memory/topics/`
- fetch-tweets + tweet-allocator disabled 2026-05-27 (aeon PR #47) — all organic-engagement candidates were spam accounts for multiple days; disable when organic signal = 0 for sustained period

## Active Targets
